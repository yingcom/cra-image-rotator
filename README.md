## Image Rotator

demo: https://4ijn1.csb.app/  

This is an web app where you can upload and rotate an image. It is implemented without the `CanvasRenderingContext2D.rotate()` API or the `transform` CSS property.

The project is created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/cra-template/template/README.md). Below are commands for some common tasks.  

`yarn` or `npm install` to add the required dependencies.  

`yarn start` or `npm start` to run the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

To make the development server only binds to `localhost`, you can create an `.env` file at the root of the project directory and add `HOST=localhost` in the `.env` file.  

`yarn test` or `npm test` to run tests in the interactive watch mode.  

`yarn build` or `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.  

`yarn eject` to remove the single build dependency from your project. This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!
